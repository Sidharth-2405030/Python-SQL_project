# Python + SQL Data Analysis on Orders Dataset

üìã Overview

This project performs an end-to-end data analysis workflow using Python and SQL.
Starting from raw orders data, I cleaned and transformed the dataset in Python, added calculated fields such as discount, sale price, and profit, and then loaded the cleaned dataset into a SQL database using SQLAlchemy.
Further analysis was done in SQL to extract business insights such as sales by region, top products, and profit trends.  

üß∞ Tools & Technologies
	‚Ä¢	Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy)
	‚Ä¢	MSSQL
	‚Ä¢	Jupyter Notebook
	‚Ä¢	GitHub

‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed

  1. Data Cleaning
	  ‚Ä¢	Removed invalid or missing entries and replaced them with NULL
	  ‚Ä¢	Standardized column formats (e.g., date ‚Üí datetime, cost/price ‚Üí float)
	  ‚Ä¢	Ensured consistent naming conventions

  2. Data Transformation
	  ‚Ä¢	Created new columns:
	  ‚Ä¢	Discount = List Price - Cost Price
	  ‚Ä¢	Sale Price = List Price - Discount
	  ‚Ä¢	Profit = Sale Price - Cost Price
	  ‚Ä¢	Verified all calculated values and data types

  3. Database Integration
	  ‚Ä¢	Established connection to SQL database using SQLAlchemy
	  ‚Ä¢	Created a new table and inserted cleaned data
	  ‚Ä¢	Verified table schema and integrity

  4. Data Analysis in SQL

  Performed SQL queries to answer key business questions:
	  ‚Ä¢	Top 5 highest-selling products in each region
	  ‚Ä¢	Compared month by month sales per year for each category of products
	  ‚Ä¢	Found which product has highest growth in profit by year
	  ‚Ä¢	For each category which month has the highest sale
